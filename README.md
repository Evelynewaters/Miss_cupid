The inspiration behind Miss Cupid stemmed from a desire to revolutionize the way people find love in the digital age. As technology continues to reshape every aspect of our lives, including how we connect with others, there was a need for a dating platform that prioritizes authenticity, safety, and genuine connections. Drawing from personal experiences and witnessing the challenges of modern dating, the idea for Miss Cupid was born. It aims to create a space where individuals can navigate the complexities of romance with confidence, knowing that they're supported by a platform that values their emotional well-being and respects their privacy. Moreover, as a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, Miss Cupid represents a fusion of technical expertise and a passion for fostering meaningful relationships in today's fast-paced world.
